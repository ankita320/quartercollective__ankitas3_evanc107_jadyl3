## Project Description

Our website will essentially be a weather news site similar to “The Stuyvesant Spectator,” NYT, and other news publications, but just for weather with more personalized features. Our website will showcase the daily weather of a certain city (typically where they live) which will be taken with their login info. It will then generate articles based on that day’s weather. For instance, if it is a snowy day, there could be articles about indoor hobbies for snowy days. That is the news part of the site. With the NYT or the Stuyvesant Spectator, there are news+ features to them as well that include crossword puzzles, word searches, wordle, and more! That is something we will implement in our website too. We will have a wordle game that will be based on weather or climate-related words.
